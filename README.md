## 🪶 Why Fold AI?

**150KB package. 65MB RAM. That's it.**  
Fold AI is built from the ground up for resource-constrained environments — lightweight is not a compromise, it's the goal.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Package Size | 150 KB |
| Memory Usage | ≤ 65 MB |
| Minimum Environment | Linux with 128MB RAM |
| Supported Platforms | Linux / Windows / Android Arm |

All icons and images are served via frontend static CDN, keeping server-side traffic minimal. Fold AI is lean enough to run as a core service on the most modest hardware.
